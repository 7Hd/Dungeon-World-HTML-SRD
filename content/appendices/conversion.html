<h1>冒險模組轉換</h1>
<p class="NoIndent">
	你並非總是會有時間做準備。可能你們尚未完全投入這個遊戲──你們只是想嘗試一下、又或者你們剛好在一場TRPG的大型集會中有段想填滿的四小時空檔，但你卻從未見過你面前的這群玩家。也許你並不怎麼注重事前準備，或者你覺得直接拿現成的地圖來遊玩會更加有趣，或更進一步，你手上有一個你最愛的老派冒險模組，且你興致勃勃地打算使用地城世界的規則來主持它。在這個附錄章節中，我們將介紹如何把其他遊戲系統的要素轉換並調整到地城世界中，並讓你能夠使用本站的規則，保留相同的彈性與自由度來運行你最喜愛的冒險模組。</p>
<hr/>

<h2>總覽</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">
	要使用地城世界的規則來準備一場冒險模組，首先，你必須仔細閱讀該冒險模組以及地城世界的規則。就地城世界的規則來說，你會需要盡可能熟悉所有的基本規則、以及關於「前置」和「GM原則」的章節。前者將引導你調適冒險模組的框架，而後者將能幫助你專注在正確的方向上──從而使遊戲維持於符合這本書列出的風格和規則。你接著需要仔細閱讀冒險模組，並在這過程中特別留意以下四個主題。</p>
<ul>
	<li>地圖</li>
	<li>怪物</li>
	<li>魔法物品</li>
	<li>NPC和組織</li></ul>
<p>
	翻閱冒險模組，在過程中做些筆記，但不要覺得你需要記住所有事情。特別著重在數據資料的段落最後通常都會被忽略，而你也會希望在冒險中留下一些空間讓你和玩家們在遊玩過程中進一步發掘。</p>
<p>
	當你完成上述準備，你將會對整個冒險故事有一個廣泛的瞭解：參與其中的勢力團體、冒險中出現的特別或帥氣怪物、存在於這個世界上的威脅和危害、以及一些玩家角色們可能會感興趣的事物。現在，先把冒險模組放到一邊，並參照地城世界的前置章節：這會是你開始大部分準備的橋段。</p>
<hr/>

<h2>前置 (Fronts)</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">
	在地城世界中，任何標準的冒險、情節、或遊戲聚會都是基於前置向外往玩家發展；前置有它預設的臨頭大難，玩家會對其作出反應，而在這之間的空白，則留給你們用玩的來看看會發生什麼事。這個道理同樣適用於冒險模組的轉換。仔細閱讀冒險模組，你將會注意到一些事物──NPC、有趣的場所、特別的怪物、以及可能對這個世界造成影響的組織、或一些等待被落實的事項。取決於冒險的規模，這些要素可能僅有少數幾個或更多。查看前置類型的列表，並利用這些要素來打造出不同的前置。</p>
<p class="Example">
	我打算要動手轉換一個我所鍾愛的老模組；我已經用許多不同的系統跑過它好幾次了，而我相信帶著我地城世界的玩家們經歷這場冒險也一定能讓他們驚艷。我快速地看過了模組的內容，讓自己回想起整個模組的大致樣貌：一座小鎮正被一個崇拜著覆鱗爬蟲之神的邪惡教團暗地威脅著。這聽起來相當有趣！在這個冒險中有一座秘密地城、腐敗的邪教教團、一大群發臭的戰蜥人、以及一群相當無助的冒險者──因為這整座小鎮都充斥著猜忌與責難。這是個情況相當惡劣的開頭，且有著許多壞事可供選擇。我決定把這些壞事統整到兩個主要的前置之中：邪教團體、以及戰蜥人部落。</p>
<p class="Example">
	現在，如果我想的話，我可以把那名住在洞穴中的納迦術士寫成一個獨立的前置，或者，我也可以為爬蟲之神本身寫一個戰役前置。不過由於我只打算為這場遊戲主持幾次聚會，因此我想讓故事集中。儘管我準備的這兩個前置會以某種方式互相作用，但它們有別於彼此，且獨立運作，因此我把它們區別了開來。</p>

<p class="NoIndent">
	你創建這些前置的方式一如往常：選擇危害、臨頭大難、以及惡兆，提出一或二個懸念，並確保你給自己保留了足夠的留白空間──這讓你能夠確實地讓角色們聯繫在一塊。通常來說，你會直接從你腦袋中的靈感萃取出這些玩意兒，但在這種情況下，你拿來轉換的冒險模組將會引導你。將這些前置想成故事的主題，並把危害當成你冒險模組中列出的元素。看看你在前置中記載的事物，如果玩家角色們完全沒有出面阻止它，事情又會怎樣發展。如果前置肆虐氾濫，它可能導致最糟的後果又是如何？這類字裡行間的資訊將會為你提供彈藥，協助你在冒險過程中進行硬動作。在這個步驟中，你將把模組中那些寫滿數據的NPC轉變成豐滿成熟的危害本身、或在前置中登場演出的成員。</p>
<p>
	如果冒險中存在任何你想為它們特別編寫自訂動作的陷阱、詛咒、或其他效果，現在就開始著手。很多老派地城冒險中都充斥著各種會要求玩家進行「豁免檢定」以避免承受有害效果的要素──這些事物經常可以被簡化成一個觸發「面對危險」擲骰的肇因，或若有必要，你也可以為它編寫一個完整且獨立的自訂動作。這裡的關鍵是要抓到冒險模組的意圖──它的精神──而不是完整轉換其中機制性的要素。</p>
<p>
	當你完成後，你將會得到一組前置，涵蓋了角色們將要面對的主要威脅以及各種危害。</p>

<h2>怪物 (Monsters)</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">Most published adventures contained one or two unique monsters not seen anywhere else—custom creatures and denizens of the deeps that could threaten players in some way they hadn’t encountered before. Take a look through the adventure and make sure you’ve caught them all. Many monsters will already have statistics noted in Dungeon World and you can, if you’re happy with them, just make a note of what page they’re on in your fronts and move on from there. If you want to further customize the monsters, or need to create your own, use the rules to do so. In this step, try to avoid thinking about “balancing” the monsters or concerning yourself too much with how many HP a monster has or whether its armor rating matches what you expect. Think more about how the monster is meant to participate in the world. Does it scare off hopeless adventurers? Is it there to bar their way or pose a riddle? What is its purpose in the greater ecology of the dungeon or adventure at large? Translating the spirit of the thing will always give you better, more engaging results. If the monster has a cool power or neat trick you want to write a custom move for, do so! Custom moves are what make Dungeon World feel unique from group to group, so take advantage of them where you can.</p>
<p class="Example">In my adventure, the monsters run the gamut. I’ve got a scary naga with some mind-controlling powers, an evil priest with divine snake-god magic, a bunch of ruffian cultists, a dragon turtle and a few miscellaneous lizards, crocodiles and snakes. Most of these I can pull from the monster settings, but I’ll create custom stats for the naga and the cultist leader, at least. I want them to feel new and different and have some cool ideas for how that might look. I use the monster creation rules to put them together.</p>
<h3>Direct Conversion</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">If you run across a monster that you haven’t already created and which you don’t know well enough to convert using the monster creation rules you can instead convert them directly.</p>
<h4>Damage</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">If the monster’s damage is a single die with a bonus of up to +10 keep it as-is. If the monster’s damage uses multiple dice of the same size roll the listed dice and take the highest result. If the monster uses multiple dice of different sizes roll only the largest and take the highest result.</p>
<h4>HP</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">If the monster’s HP is listed as Hit Dice take the maximum value of the first HD and add one for each additional hit dice. If the monster’s HP is listed as a number with no Hit Dice divide the HP by 4.</p>
<h4>Armor</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">If the monster’s AC is average give it 1 armor. If the monster’s AC is low, give it 0 armor. If the monster’s AC is high give it 2 armor, 3 armor for beasts that are all about defense. If it’s nearly invulnerable, 4 armor. +1 armor if its defenses are magical.</p>
<h4>Moves and Instinct</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Look at the special abilities or attacks listed for the monster, these form the basis for its moves.</p>

<h2>地圖 (Maps)</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">One of the biggest differences between Dungeon World and many other fantasy RPGs is the concept of maps and mapping. In many games, you’ll see a square-by-square map denoting precisely what goes where, often presented to give as much detail as possible and leave little to the imagination save the description of the location in question. Dungeon World often leans the opposite direction—maps marked with empty space and a one or two word description like “blades” or “scary.” To adapt an existing adventure for use in Dungeon World, simply keep in mind your principles and agenda. Primarily, keep in mind that as the GM, it’s your job to “draw maps, leave blanks” and to “ask questions and use the answers.”</p>
<p>To that end, it’s often best to re-draw the map entirely, if you have time. Don’t copy it inch-by-inch but redraw it freehand, leaving spaces and drawing out new rooms, if you’d like. Don’t stick to the map exactly as written, but give yourself some creative license. The idea here is to give yourself room to expand—to allow the players’ reaction to the adventure to surprise and inspire you. If you’ve got the whole map nailed down in advance, there’s nowhere to go you don’t already know about, is there? Pick a few rooms that don’t interest you and wipe out their inhabitants. Draw a new tunnel or two. This will give you some space to play around once you get into the game itself.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the time or inclination to re-draw the map, don’t worry. Just take the original map, make a few notes about what might go where and leave the rest blank. When the players go into that room marked “4f” don’t look it up, just make a guess at what might be there based on your notes and what else has been happening. You’ll find a comfortable balance between freely playing out what happens and consulting your prep as you go along.</p>
<p class="Example">The maps that come with my adventure are a good mix of fun and cool and sort of boring fluff. I’ll keep most of what the dungeon describes under the city—the lair of the troglodytes and the secret caves where the captive villagers are being kept—but I’m going to throw away a lot of the stuff about the village itself and just leave blank spaces. It’ll give me room to use the answers to questions like “Who do you already know, here?” and “Who lives in the abandoned hut up the road?” I’ve made some notes about where the map and my fronts intersect, but mostly I’ve just given myself room to explore.</p>

<h2>魔法&amp;財寶 (Magic &amp; Treasure)</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">Two things that are, traditionally, a “big deal” in published modules are treasure and magic items. This is less relevant in Dungeon World (as the reward cycle for characters is more about “doing” than about “having”) but it’s still fun to drudge through a dungeon or explore lost ruins and come up with cool magic items and piles of gold! Like the map, it’s useful to get an idea of the kinds of stuff that might be found in the adventure—anything particularly called out in the text as relevant to the adventure itself (a magic sword that can be used to wound the golem on level 4, or a pendant belonging to the prince captured in room 3) is particularly important. Like monsters, it’s better to look at magic items in terms of what purpose they fulfill: what they’re “for” rather than the damage or armor bonus they might give. Dungeon World isn’t built on balancing treasure against character level, for example, so just look through the adventure for items that seem cool or fun or interesting and create new magic items (with custom moves as necessary) wherever you think it’s needed. This is possibly the easiest step of conversion. Again, you can leave yourself exploratory room, here. Make notes to yourself like “The wizard has a magic staff, what does it do?” and find that out in play. Ask the players about it, see what they have to say. Let spout lore do some work for you. “You’ve heard that the wizard here has a strange magical staff. What rumors have you heard of its origins?”</p>

<h2>Introductory Moves</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">This step is entirely optional, but can be really useful when running through an adventure for a convention group or other group where running through a full “first session” process just isn’t possible. You can take variables of the adventure and create “hooks” for that adventure, writing custom moves to be made after character creation but before play starts. These moves will serve to engage the characters in the fiction and give them something special to prepare them or hook them into what’s about to happen. You can write one for each class, or bundle them together, if you like. Here’s an example:</p>
<p class="Example">Fighter, someone who loves you gave you a gift before you left for a life of adventure. Roll+CHA and tell us how much they love you. On a 10+ pick two heirlooms, on a 7-9 pick one. On a miss, well, good intentions count for something, right?</p>
<ul><li>A vial of antivenom</li>
<li>A shield that glows with silver light</li>
<li>A rusted old key in the shape of a lizard</li></ul>
<p class="NoIndent">These sorts of moves can give the players the sense that their characters are tied to the situation at hand, and open the door for more lines of question-and-answer play that can fill the game world with life. Think about the fronts, the things they endanger, the riches they might protect and their impact on the world. Let these intro moves flow from that understanding, creating a great kickstart to the adventure.</p>
