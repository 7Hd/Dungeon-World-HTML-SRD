Title: "世界"

<h1>世界</h1>
<p class="NoIndent">
	冒險的生活大半都是在塵土飛揚的遺棄古墓、或是在充斥著恐懼和生命危險的場所中度過。從短暫而間斷的休息中醒轉，發現自己仍處於世界深處且被敵群環繞，也早已是再常見不過的風景。然而當是時候從這些險境中走出──無論是滿載戰利品、或是在浴血重傷中被擊倒敗退──冒險者們終將需要尋求安全和慰藉之所。</p>
<p>
	這些都是文明世界帶來的舒適生活：洗個溫暖的熱水澡、享用蜂蜜酒配鬆軟麵包的一餐、與人類、精靈、矮人、和半身人為伴。渴望回到這溫暖歸宿的念頭正是讓冒險者永遠不會在危難中放棄的理由。所有人都在為金錢與榮譽奮鬥，但又有誰不希望能有個歸處，讓他們盡情揮霍金錢、在爐火邊談笑、並聆聽那些荒唐蠢事和冒險故事呢？</p>
<p>
	這個章節涵蓋了關於更廣闊的世界──在地城外那寬廣而開闊的天地。GM前置那不斷前進發展的步伐將形塑這個世界的風貌，而另一方面，這個世界也會反映玩家們採取的行動，呈現出他們為了阻止危害、或改變故事方向時而造成的種種影響。</p>

<h3>聚落 (Steadings)</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">
	在這裡，我們把各式各樣大大小小的社區、城鎮等，這類有地方可以居住，且擁有社會文明的場所稱作「<strong>聚落</strong>」。聚落是一個至少有著些許居民（通常為人類）居住、以及穩定建築物的場所。它的規模可以大到如首都般繁盛、也可以小到只陳列著寥寥幾棟搖搖欲墜的破敗建築。</p>

<hr/>
<h2>創造世界</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">
	還記得你是怎麼開始你的第一次聚會嗎？他們的冒險是正在進行、還是即將開始？有些時候，角色們將會需要從冒險中抽離，撤退返鄉以治癒他們身上的傷口、或為了慶祝勝利並重新補給。</p>
<p>
	當玩家們為了回到安全的文明場所而離開他們經歷第一次冒險的地點，那就是你們開始繪製戰役地圖的時候了。拿出一張大面積的紙張（可以是純白紙張、或你想要更酷炫一點的話也可以使用畫有六邊形格線的空白地圖），將它放置在所有人都能看到的地方，並在地圖上標記該次冒險發生的位置。請使用鉛筆繪製：畢竟這張地圖在之後也將不斷改變。取決於你的喜好，這張地圖可以是按比例繪製且充滿細節、也可以只是大致而抽象的標記出地點，但無論如何，記得讓上面的內容明顯可見。盡量控制每個地圖標記的大小，並讓它們維持在地圖的中心位置，這樣你才有足夠的空間向周圍擴展你的世界。</p>
<p>
	現在，把距離角色們最近的聚落添加到地圖上，這就是角色們接著可以前往休息並重新補給的場所。為這個場所在地圖上畫上標記，並在中間填上一些地形特徵。試著讓這中間的路程維持在一到兩天之內：一段越過崎嶇岩山或茂密森林的短程旅行、或者一段距離較長，但沿著道路或開闊平原前進的路線都相當合適。</p>
<p>
	在你花了點時間（比如說在第一次聚會之後、或在中場休息期間）利用規則創造你的第一個聚落之後，也考慮一下把其他目前曾被提及的場所也添加到地圖上，這些地點也許是來自角色創造時提及的細節、或是來自聚落規則本身。</p>

<hr/>
<h2>當你來到聚落時…</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">
	當玩家們造訪一個聚落時，他們將有一些能夠在此時進行的特殊動作。這些動作仍然遵守遊戲中的敘事流程，當玩家們抵達聚落時，問他們：「你們打算做什麼？」，而玩家們接下來採取的行動也經常就會觸發列表中的某個動作。這些動作涵括了歇息、恢復元氣、和補給物資──並提供玩家們一個鎮靜下來、揮霍他們獲得的財寶的機會。要記住，待在聚落並代表著隔絕於現實之外，你仍然需要在必要的時候進行硬動作，並時時思考玩家們的作為（或不作為）會如何推動你前置的發展。你所設定的臨頭大難一直都在那裏，無論玩家們是在地城中奮戰、或在當地酒館中酩酊大醉都一樣。</p>
<p>
	不要讓造訪聚落這件事永遠都代表著喘息的機會。要記住，地城世界是個可怕危險的場所。若玩家們決定忽略這些危險，那他們就是在提供你一個進行硬動作的黃金時機。讓角色們的生命充滿冒險，無論他們是否追求於此。而也正是因為這些動作，你才得以將造訪城鎮變成一個意義非凡的有趣事件，而不是花整個聚會的時間糾結爭論某個漂亮佩飾的價格。</p>

<hr/>
<h2 class="BasicMoveName">聚落的要素 (Elements of a Steading)</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">
	聚落代表著任何能夠提為其居民提供一定程度安全性的文明區域。村莊、小鎮、要塞、和城市是最為常見的聚落類型。與裝備相同，聚落的描述會透過其標籤來進行。所有的聚落都有著象徵它們經濟程度、人口數量、以及防禦能力的標籤。而大部分聚落也還會擁有其他標籤，用來描繪它們不同尋常的性質。</p>
<p>
	聚落主要根據其規模大小來進行區分。規模代表著這個聚落大致能夠容納的人數。而人口標籤則會告訴你目前這個聚落中的人數是超過還是低於這個數量。</p>
<p>
	村莊 是規模最小的聚落。它們通常地處偏僻、坐落於遠離主要大道的區域。若它們運氣夠好，或許他們能聚集起一些用來保衛自己的人力，但通常也不過就是一群拿著乾草叉和火炬的烏合之眾。村莊鄰近於一些易於開發的資源附近：像是肥沃的土壤、豐富的漁獲、古老森林、或礦場。這裡或許會有某些形式的商店，但更多的是居民之間彼此交易。貨幣在這裡相當罕見。</p>
<p>Towns have a hundred or so inhabitants. They’re the kind of place that springs up around a mill, trading post, or inn and usually have fields, farms, and livestock of some kind. They might have a standing militia of farmers strong enough to wield a blade or shoot a bow. Towns have the basics for sale but certainly no special goods. Usually they’ll focus on a local product or two and do some trade with travelers.</p>
<p>A keep is a steading built specifically for defense—sometimes of a particularly important location like a river delta or a rich gold mine. Keeps are found at the frontier edges of civilization. Inhabitants are inured to the day-to-day dangers of the road. They’re tough folks that number between a hundred and a thousand, depending on the size of the keep and the place it defends. Keeps won’t often have much beyond their own supplies, traded to them from nearby villages, but will almost always have arms and armor and sometimes a rare magical item found in the local wilds.</p>
<p>From bustling trade center to sprawling metropolis, the city represents the largest sort of steading in Dungeon World. These are places where folk of many races and kinds can be found. They often exist at the confluence of a handful of trade routes or are built in a place of spiritual significance. They don’t often generate their own raw materials for trade, relying on supplies from villages nearby for food and resources, but will always have crafted goods and some stranger things for sale to those willing to seek them.</p>
<p>Prosperity indicates what kinds of items are usually available. Population indicates the number of inhabitants relative to the current size of the steading. Defenses indicate the general scope of arms the steading has. Tags in these categories can be adjusted. -Category means to change the steading to the next lower tag for that category (so Moderate would become Poor with -Prosperity). +Category means to change the steading to the next higher tag (so Shrinking becomes Steady with +Population). Tags in those categories can also be compared like numbers. Treat the lowest tag in that category as 1 and each successive tag as the next number (so Dirt is 1, Poor is 2, etc.).</p>
<p>Tags will change over the course of play. Creating a steading provides a snapshot of what that place looks like <em>right now</em>. As the players spend time in it and your fronts progress the world will change and your steadings with it.</p>

<h3>添加聚落 (Adding Steadings)</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">You add your first steading when you create the campaign map—it’s the place the players go to rest and recover. When you first draw it on the map all you need is a name and a location.</p>
<p>When you have the time you’ll use the rules below to create the steading. The first steading is usually a village, but you can use a town if the first adventure was closely tied to humans (for example, if the players fought a human cult). Create it using the rules below.</p>
<p>Once you’ve created the first steading you can add other places referenced in its tags (the oath, trade, and enmity tags in particular) or anywhere else that’s been referred to in play. Don’t add too much in the first session, leave blanks and places to explore.</p>
<p>As play progresses the characters will discover new locales and places of interest either directly, by stumbling upon them in the wild, or indirectly, by hearing about them in rumors or tales. Add new steadings, dungeons, and other locations to the map as they’re discovered or heard about. Villages are often near a useful resource. Towns are often found at the point where several villages meet to trade. Keeps watch over important locations. Cities rely on the trade and support of smaller steads. Dungeons can be found anywhere and in many forms.</p>
<p>Whenever you add a new steading use the rules to decide its tags. Consider adding a distinctive feature somewhere nearby. Maybe a forest, some old standing stones, an abandoned castle, or whatever else catches your fancy or makes sense. A map of only steadings and ruins with nothing in between is dull; don’t neglect the other features of the world.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>戰役地圖中的前置 (Fronts on the Campaign Map)</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">Your steadings are not the only thing on the campaign map. In addition to steadings and the areas around them your fronts will appear on the map, albeit indirectly.</p>
<p>Fronts are organizational tools, not something the characters think of, so don’t put them on the map directly. The orcs of Olg’gothal may be a front but don’t just draw them on the map. Instead for each front add some feature to the map that indicates the front’s presence. You can label it if you like, but use the name that the characters would use, not the name you gave the front.</p>
<p>For example, the orcs of Olg’gothal could be marked on the map with a burning village they left behind, fires in the distance at night, or a stream of refugees. Lord Xothal, a lich, might be marked by the tower where dead plants take root and grow.</p>
<p>As your fronts change, change the map. If the players cleanse Xothal’s tower redraw it. If the orcs are driven off erase the crowds of refugees.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>更新戰役地圖 (Updating the Campaign Map)</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">The campaign map is updated between sessions or whenever the players spend significant downtime in a safe place. Updates are both prescriptive and descriptive: if an event transpires that, say, gathers a larger fighting force to a village, update the tags to reflect that. Likewise if a change in tags mean that a village has a bigger fighting force you’ll likely see more armored men in the street.</p>
<p>Between each session check each of the conditions below. Go down the list and check each condition for all steadings before moving to the next. If a condition applies, apply its effects.</p>
<h4>Growth</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">When <strong>a village or town is booming and its prosperity is above moderate</strong> you may reduce prosperity and defenses to move to the next largest type. New towns immediately gain market and new cities immediately gain guild (your choice).</p>
<h4>Collapse</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">When <strong>a steading’s population is in exodus and its prosperity is poor or less</strong> it shrinks. A city becomes a town with a steady population and +prosperity. A keep becomes a town with +defenses and a steady population. A town becomes a village with steady population and +prosperity. A village becomes a ghost town.</p>
<h4>Want</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">When <strong>a steading has a need that is not fulfilled</strong> (through trade, capture, or otherwise) that steading is in want. It gets either -prosperity, -population, or loses a tag based on that resource like craft or trade, your choice.</p>
<h4>Trade</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">When <strong>trade is blocked</strong> because the source of that trade is gone, the route is endangered, or political reasons, the steading has a choice: gain need (a traded good) or take -prosperity.</p>
<h4>Capture</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">When <strong>control of a resource changes</strong> remove that resource from the tags of the previous owner and add it to the tags of the new owner (if applicable). If the previous owner has a craft or trade based on that resource they now have need (that resource). If the new owner had a need for that resource, remove it.</p>
<h4>Profit</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">When <strong>a steading has more trade than its current prosperity</strong> it gets +prosperity.</p>
<h4>Surplus</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">When <strong>a steading has a resource that another steading needs</strong> unless enmity or other diplomatic reasons prevent it they set up trade. The steading with the resource gets +prosperity and their choice of oaths, +population, or +defenses; the steading with the need erases that need and adds trade.</p>
<h4>Aid</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">When <strong>a steading has oaths to a steading under attack</strong> that steading may take -defenses to give the steading under attack +defenses.</p>
<h4>Embattled</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">When <strong>a steading is surrounded by enemy forces</strong> it suffers losses. If it fights back with force it gets -defenses. If its new defenses are watch or less it also gets -prosperity. If it instead tries to wait out the attack it gets -population. If its new population is shrinking or less it loses a tag of your choice. If the steading’s defenses outclass the attacker’s (your call if it’s not clear, or make it part of an adventure front) the steading is no longer surrounded.</p>
<h4>Opportunity</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">When <strong>a steading has enmity against a weaker steading</strong> they may attack. Subtract the distance (in rations) between the steadings from the steading with enmity’s defenses. If the result is greater than the other steading’s defenses +defense for each step of size difference (village to town, town to keep, keep to city) they definitely attack. Otherwise it’s your call: has anything happened recently to stoke their anger? The forces of the attacker embattle the defender, while they maintain the attack they’re -defenses.</p>
<h4>Clash</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">When <strong>two steadings both attack each other</strong> their forces meet somewhere between them and fight. If they’re evenly matched they both get -defenses and their troops return home. If one has the advantage they take -defenses while the other takes -2 defenses.</p>
<h3>Other Updates</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">The conditions above detail the most basic of interactions between steadings, of course the presence of your fronts and the players mean things can get far more complex. Since tags are descriptive, add them as needed to reflect the players’ actions and your fronts’ effects on the world.</p>
