Title: "德魯伊"

<h1>德魯伊</h1>
<div id="intro"><p class="NoIndent">環視火堆周圍，這些人滿是城市的塵埃與汗味，是什麼將你帶到這些人身邊？或許是慈愛吧──你是否如同母熊照看她的幼崽保護著他們？他們現在是你這群的嗎？你可真有群奇怪的兄弟姊妹。不管你有怎樣的靈感，沒有你銳利的感官和更銳利的獠爪，他們註定不會成功。</p>
<p>你屬於神聖之所；你出生於母土，你的身上戴著她的靈魂之印。你可能也曾有過凡人的生活，或許你也像他們曾居於都城，如今卻已非如此。你拋棄了停滯的定型。聆聽你盟友對他們所雕神像的祈禱，聆聽他們的宗教寓言故事，講述他們將在早已被你拋棄的破爛小鎮中找回的榮耀。</p>
<p>他們的諸神只是年幼的孩童，他們的鋼鐵只是虛假的保護。你走在古老的路上，披大地為衣。你會拿取屬於你的財寶，但你是否會走上與他們相同的路呢？只有時間知道。</p></div>

<div id="racialmoves">
<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">精靈</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">The sap of the elder trees flows within you. In addition to any other attunements, the Great Forest is always considered your land.</p></div>
<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">人類</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">As your people learned to bind animals to field and farm, so too are you bound to them. You may always take the shape of any domesticated animal, in addition to your normal options.</p></div>
<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">半身人</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">You sing the healing songs of spring and brook. When you make camp, you and your allies heal +1d6.</p></div></div>

<div id="classmoves"><p class="Instructions">你起始還擁有以下動作：</p>
<div class="Move"><div id="BornoftheSoil"><h3 class="BasicMoveName">Born of the Soil</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">You learned your magic in a place whose spirits are strong and ancient and they’ve marked you as one of their own. No matter where you go, they live within you and allow you to take their shape. Choose one of the following. It is the land to which you are attuned—when shapeshifting you may take the shape of any animal who might live in your Land.</p>
<ul><li class="Option">The Great Forests</li>
<li class="Option">The Whispering Plains</li>
<li class="Option">The Vast Desert</li>
<li class="Option">The Stinking Mire</li>

<li class="Option">The Towering Mountains</li>
<li class="Option">The Frozen North</li>
<li class="Option">The Blasted Wasteland</li></ul>
<p class="NoIndent">Chose a tell—a physical attribute that marks you as born of the soil—that reflects the spirit of your land. It may be an animal feature like antlers or leopard’s spots or something more general: hair like leaves or eyes of glittering crystal. Your tell remains no matter what shape you take.</p></div></div>
<div class="Move"><div id="ByNatureSustained"><h3 class="BasicMoveName">By Nature Sustained</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">You don’t need to eat or drink. If a move tells you to mark off a ration just ignore it.</p></div></div>
<div class="Move"><div id="SpiritTongue"><h3 class="BasicMoveName">Spirit Tongue</h3>

<p class="NoIndent">When you call upon the spirits to change your shape, roll+Wis. ✴On a 10+ hold 3. ✴On a 7–9 hold 2. ✴On a miss hold 1 in addition to whatever the GM says.</p>
<p>You may take on the physical form of any species whose essence you have studied or who lives in your land: you and your possessions meld into a perfect copy of the species’ form. You have any innate abilities and weaknesses of the form: claws, wings, gills, breathing water instead of air. You still use your normal stats but some moves may be harder to trigger—a housecat will find it hard to do battle with an ogre. The GM will also tell you one or more moves associated with your new form. Spend 1 hold to make that move. Once you’re out of hold, you return to your natural form. At any time, you may spend all your hold and revert to your natural form.</p></div></div>
<div class="Move"><div id="StudiedEssence"><h3 class="BasicMoveName">Studied Essence</h3>
