<div id="moves"><p class="InstructionsAfterHeader">當你的等級升至2~5，從下列動作中選擇：</p>

<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">Lore of Flame</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">
	When you stare into a source of fire, looking for answers, roll+WIS On a hit, the GM will tell you something new and interesting about the current situation. On a 10+, the GM will give you good detail. On a 7–9, the GM will give you an impression. If you already know all there is to know, the GM will tell you that.</p></div>

<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">Burns Twice as Bright</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">
	When you channel the flames of fate, you may treat a missed roll as a 7-9 or a 7-9 result as a 10+. This may be a roll you or another character has made. Tell the GM something you’ve lost; an emotion, a memory or some innate piece of your being. You may not use this move again until you’ve used Burns Half As Long.</p></div>

<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">Burns Half as Long</h3>
<p>
	You gain this move when you gain Burns Twice as Bright.</p>
<p class="NoIndent">
	When you sacrifice a victory to the flames of fate, treat any roll of 10+ as a miss.</p></div>

<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">This Killing Fire</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">
	Add the following tags to your options for Burning Brand: messy, forceful, reach, near, far</p></div>

<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">Firebrand</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">
	When you introduce a new idea to an NPC, roll+CHA. On a 10+ They believe the idea to be their own and take to it with fervor On a 7-9, Their passion fades after a day or two. On a miss, they respond negatively, speaking out against the idea.</p></div>

<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">Ogdru Jahad</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">
	Gain the Wizard move Ritual. The GM will always tell you what you have to sacrifice to gain the effect you desire.</p></div>

<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">Moth to the Flame</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">
	When you tempt a weak mind with your inner fire, roll+WIS. On a 10+ their will is suppressed, they’ll follow you and do as you desire, so long as nothing startles or surprises them. On a 7-9, the effect is only strong enough to distract or confuse them. On a miss, they become agitated and upset, your fire having sparked their hidden desires.</p></div>

<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">Burning Bridges</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">
	When you would take your last breath, don’t. Instead, you may erase one of your Bonds. This is permanent and lowers your total available Bonds forever. You are alive and have 1d6 hp. If you have no more Bonds, take your last breath as normal.</p></div>

<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">The Enkindler</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">
	When you bolster the courage of others roll+CHA. On a 10+ they shake off all fear and doubt, becoming brave in an instant. On a 7-9, this effect is fleeting, they realize its superficiality and resort to cowardice after a moment or two. On a miss, they’re cowed or terrified by your presence.</p></div>

<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">Sick Burn</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">
	When you insult an NPC, roll + CHA. On a 10+ you leave them no room to react, they bear your insult and the scorn of all who hear it. On a 7-9 you cross a line, they will have their revenge, someday. On a miss you’ve gone too far, they blow up here and now.</p></div>

<p class="Instructions">當你的等級升至6~10，從下列動作或等級2~5的動作中選擇：</p>

<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">From Hell’s Heart</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">
	Whenever you summon fire with any of your moves, you can replace it with the black fires of hell itself. This fire does not burn with heat and ignores armor, scorching the soul itself. Those creatures without souls cannot be harmed by this type of flame.</p></div>

<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">Burning Ring of Fire</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">
	When you fuse a willing person’s soul to yours, roll+CHA. On a hit you are bound together, able to sense each other at any distance, as well as sharing your emotional state. On a 7-9, the connection is unstable and dangerous, when you take a debility, so do they (and vice versa). On a miss, the branding is rejected and you both erase any Bonds you have to each other. You may write new Bonds with them at the End of Session as usual. This fusion, once performed, cannot be undone by mortal means.</p></div>

<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">Fanning the Flames</h3>
<p class="Requirement">需求: Firebrand</p>
<p class="NoIndent">
	You may apply the effects of your Firebrand move to a group of people – a dozen or so – all at once.</p></div>

<div class="Move"><h3 class="MoveName">Watch the World Burn</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">
	When you open a channel to the burning planes and call a firestorm, tell the GM what you’re sacrificing and roll+WIS. The sky opens up and fire pours like rain from it within an area about equal to a small village. Everyone and everything in the area takes damage as appropriate. On a 10+ you can extinguish the storm with a little effort. On a 7-9 the fires rage out of your control, spreading and gusting where they are carried by wind and weather. On a miss, something cruel, intelligent and hungry comes with the storm.</p></div></div>
