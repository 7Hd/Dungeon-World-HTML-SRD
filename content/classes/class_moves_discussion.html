<h1>職業動作詳解</h1>

<hr/>
<h1>兼職動作</h1>
<div class="Inner">
	<h2>兼職新手 (Multiclass Dabbler)</h2>
	<h2>兼職學徒 (Multiclass Initiate)</h2>
	<h2>兼職大師 (Multiclass Master)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">
		對於這些兼職動作而言，將牧師的<b>通神</b>和<b>施放法術</b>動作視為一個動作。同樣的，法師的<b>法術書</b>、<b>準備法術</b>、和<b>施放法術</b>動作也是如此。</p>
	<p>
		當你第一次選擇能讓你獲得施放法術能力的兼職動作時，你把你自己視作等級 1 的該施法職業來準備和施放法術。每當你在這之後升級時，你用來準備和施放法術的師法者等級也會跟著提升 1 級。</p>
	<p class="Example">
		當埃阿斯升到 3 級時，他選擇獲得了 兼職新手 動作，並藉此得到牧師職業中的 通神 和 施放法術 動作。他將如同等級一的牧師一樣準備和施放法術：他只能使用禱念以及等級 1 的法術，且只能夠準備等級總和為 2 級的法術。當他之後升到 4 級時，他將能夠如同等級二的牧師一樣準備和施放法術。</p>
</div>

<hr/>
<h1>吟遊詩人動作</h1>
<div class="Inner">
	<h2>詩人逸聞 (Bardic Lore)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">
		將你逸聞的專業領域當成書本。你方才遭遇到的向上逆流瀑布是否是個重要的場所？又是否會被記載一本標題為「法術和魔法」的書本或大學課程中呢？若答案是肯定的，那麼你就可以應用「法術和魔法」的詩人逸聞領域。</p>
	<p>
		如果你對這些事物的關心足以讓你提出關於它們的問題，那麼它或許就真的很重要。不要懷疑自己：如果你你確實在意到想多知道一些關於它們的情報，那它就確實有一定的重要性。</p>

	<h2>敞開心胸 (Charming and Open)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">Speaking frankly means you really are being open with them, not just giving the appearance of openness. It’s your true sincerity that puts others at ease and lets you get information out of them; if you’re trying to maintain a lie at the same time you won’t get very far.</p>

	<h2>超越極限 (It Goes To Eleven)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">Of course, the creature you effect must have some way of harming your target of choice. Spurring a wolf into a frenzy to attack the eagle lord circling above doesn’t do any good, the wolf doesn’t have a way to attack it.</p>

	<h2>魔法知音 (An Ear For Magic)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">Acting on the answers can mean acting against them or taking advantage of them. Either way you take +1 forward.</p>
</div>

<hr/>
<h1>牧師動作</h1>
<div class="Inner">
	<h2>通神 (Commune)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">
		若你希望，你可以準備同一個法術超過一次。</p>
</div>

<hr/>
<h1>牧師法術</h1>
<div class="Inner">
	<h2>神導術 (Guidance)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">It’s up to the creativity of your deity (and the GM) to communicate as much as possible through the motions and gestures of your deity’s symbol. You don’t get visions or a voice from heaven, just some visual cue of what your deity would have you do (even if it’s not in your best interest).</p>
	<h2>魔化武器 (Magic Weapon)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">Casting Magic Weapon on the same weapon again has no effect. No matter how many times you cast it on the same weapon it’s still just magic +1d4 damage.</p>
	<p>That said, even a weak enchantment is nothing to be scoffed at. Having a magic weapon may give you an advantage against some of the stranger beasts of Dungeon World, ghosts and the like. The exact effects depend on the monster and circumstances, so make the most of it.</p>
	<h2>活化死屍 (Animate Dead)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">Treating the zombie as your character means you make moves with its stats based on the fiction, just like always. Unless its brain is functioning on its own, the zombie can’t do much besides follow the last order it was given, so you’d better stay close. Even if its brain works it’s still bound to follow your orders.</p>
</div>

<hr/>
<h1>戰士動作</h1>
<div class="Inner">
	<h2>招牌武器 (Signature Weapon)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">The base description you choose is just a description. Choosing a spear doesn’t give you Close range, for example. You could choose a spear as the description, then Hand as the range. Your spear is something special, or your technique with it is different, just describe why your weapon has the tags you’ve chosen.</p>
	<h2>傳家之寶 (Heirloom)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">The exact nature of the spirits (and therefore what knowledge they can offer to you) is up to you and the GM to decide. Maybe they’re dead ancestors, echoes of people you’ve slain, or a minor demon. Up to you.</p>
	<h2>護甲精通 (Armor Mastery)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">Armor and shields that are reduced to 0 armor are effectively destroyed. You’ll pretty much be paying for a new one anyway, so you might as well drop them and haul out some gold instead.</p>
</div>

<hr/>
<h1>聖武士動作</h1>
<div class="Inner">
	<h2>信仰之證 (Evidence of Faith)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">Your +1 forward applies to anything you do based on your knowledge of the spell’s effects: defying it, defending against it, using it to your advantage, etc.</p>
</div>

<hr/>
<h1>遊俠動作</h1>
<div class="Inner">
	<h2>命令 (Command)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">Your bonuses only apply when your animal is doing something it’s trained in. An animal not trained to attack monsters won’t be any help when you’re attacking an otyugh.</p>
</div>

<hr/>
<h1>盜賊動作</h1>
<div class="Inner">
	<h2>背刺 (Backstab)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">Reducing armor until they repair it means that they lose armor until they do something that compensates for your damage. If you’re fighting an armored knight that might mean a fresh suit of armor, but for a thick-hided ogre it’s until they’ve had time to heal up (or protect the wound you left).</p>
	<h2>施毒者 (Poisoner)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">In order to make more doses of your chosen poison you need to be reasonably able to gather the required materials. If you’re locked up at the top of a tower you’re not going to be able to get the materials you need.</p>
	<h2>財富與品味 (Wealth and Taste)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">In order to use this move it’s really got to be your most valuable possession. It’s the honest value you place on it that draws others, no lies.</p>
	<h2>易容偽裝 (Disguise)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">Your disguise covers your appearance and any basics like accents and limps. It doesn’t grant you any special knowledge of the target, so if someone asks you what your favorite color is you’d better think fast. Defying danger with CHA is a common part of maintaining a disguise.</p>
</div>

<hr/>
<h1>法師動作</h1>
<div class="Inner">
	<h2>準備法術 (Prepare Spells)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">
		若你希望，你可以準備同一個法術超過一次。</p>

	<h2>強效魔法 (Empowered Magic)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">Maximizing the effects of a spell is simple for spells that involve a roll: a maximized Magic Missile does 8 damage. In other cases it’s down to the circumstances. A maximized Identify might result in far more information than expected. If there’s no clear way to maximize it you can’t choose that option.</p>
	<p>Likewise for doubling the targets. If the spell doesn’t have targets you can’t choose to double them.</p>
</div>

<hr/>
<h1>法師法術</h1>
<div class="Inner">
	<h2>解除魔法 (Dispel Magic)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">The exact effects depend on the circumstances. A goblin orkaster’s spell might just be ended, while a deity’s consecration is probably just dimmed. The GM will tell you the likely effects of Dispelling a given effect before you cast.</p>
	<h2>火球術 (Fireball)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">“Nearby”depends on context; a few paces or so in an open space, considerably more in an enclosed room. Be careful!.</p>
	<h2>變形術 (Polymorph)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">In some cases the GM may choose the last option more than once to list each unexpected benefit or weakness.</p>
	<h2>怪物召喚術 (Summon Monster)</h2>
	<p class="NoIndent">The exact type of monster you get is up to the GM, based on your choices. If you want a non-reckless swimming creature you might get a water elemental, a 1d8 damage +2 Str creature might be a barbed devil. Whatever the creature is you still get to play it.</p>
</div>
