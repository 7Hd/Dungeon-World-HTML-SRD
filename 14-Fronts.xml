<h1>Fronts</h1>
<Body><p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Fronts are secret tomes of GM knowledge. With the exception of a few sneaky PC tricks Fronts are your purview and are a place where you’ll build the adversaries, organizations, and other misfortune that the characters will come in conflict with. A Front is a collection of linked Dangers—threats to the characters specifically and to the people, places and things the characters care about. It also includes one or more Impending Dooms, the horrible things that will happen without the players' intervention. “Fronts” comes, of course, from “fighting on two fronts” which is just where you want your characters to be—in a world full of all kinds of danger.</p>
<p>Fronts are built outside of active play. They’re the solo fun that you get to have between games—rubbing your hands and cackling evilly to yourself as you craft the foes with which to challenge your PCs. You may tweak or adjust the Fronts during play (who knows when inspiration will strike?) but the meat of them comes from preparation between sessions.</p>
<p>These Fronts are designed to help you organize your thoughts on PC opposition. They’re here to contain your notes, ideas, and plans for these opposing forces. When you’re in a bind your Fronts are where you’re going to turn and say “oh, so <em>that</em>’s what I should do”. Consider them an organizational tool, as inspiration for present and future mayhem.</p>
<p>When you’re building Fronts, think about all the creepy dungeon denizens, the rampaging hordes and ancient cults that you’d like to see in your game. Think in broad strokes at first and then, as you build Dangers into your Fronts, you’ll be able to narrow those ideas down. When you write your Campaign Front, think about session-to-session plots. When you write your Dungeon Fronts, think about what’s important right now. When you’re done writing a few Fronts you’ll be ready to run Dungeon World—equipped with all the tools you’ll need to challenge your players.</p>
<h3>Campaign and Adventure Fronts</h3>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">At their core, Fronts contain the same components. They sort and gather your Dangers into easy-to-use clusters. There are, however, two different kinds of Fronts available to you. On the session-to-session level there’s your Adventure Fronts. These fronts will see use for 3 or 4 sessions each; likely they only have one or two Impending Dooms to resolve. They’re tied to a single problem and will be dealt with or cast aside as the PCs wander the dungeon or uncover the plot at hand. Think of them as your episodic content: “Today, on Dungeon World…”</p>
<p>Tying your Adventure Fronts together is your Campaign Front. While the Adventure Fronts will contain immediate Dangers—the Orcs in Hargrosh Pass, say—the Campaign Front contains the Dark God Grishkar who drives the Orcs to their pillaging. The Campaign Front is the story arcs that span your whole campaign. The Campaign Front will have slower-burning Impending Dooms but they’ll be bigger and badder. And they'll be scarier if they resolve.</p>
<p>When a Danger from a Adventure Front goes without resolution you’ll have to make a decision. If the Danger is something you like and feel has a place in the larger story of your game don’t hesitate to move it to the Campaign Front. You’re able to make smaller Dangers that went unresolved into bigger Dangers some day later on. You can move Dangers from the Campaign Fronts to the an Adventure Front if you’re ready for the big showdown, too.</p>
<h2>Creating Fronts</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Here’s how a Front comes together:</p>
<ul><li>Choose Campaign Front or Adventure Front</li>
<li>Create 2–3 Dangers</li>
<li>Choose their Impending Doom</li>
<li>(For an Adventure Front, 1–3 Grim Portents)</li>
<li>(For the Campaign Front, 3–5 Grim Portents)</li>
<li>Write 1–3 stakes questions</li>
<li>List the general cast of the Front</li></ul>
<h2>Creating Dangers</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">There are a few categories of Danger. While the Impending Doom is the dark thing at the end of the road that define why the Danger is, these categories describe what. These categories are further divided within. Not every single element of your game will warrant a Danger—traps, some roving monsters, bits of ephemera. That’s okay. Dangers, and Fronts, are to keep you appraised of the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Every Danger has a core "impulse" that drives it. These are notes to help you understand the motivation that every Danger carries. What pushes it to fulfill its Impending Doom? Impulse is a good answer to "why?" when it comes to Dangers.</p>
<p>When creating Dangers for a Front, think of each Danger as a facet of the larger Front. If your Front is "The Swarming Halls of Xu'th'cal" you can start creating dangers by asking four basic questions: who, what, where, and why?</p>
<p>When you think about the who of the Front look for groups and significant individuals that drive the front directly or indirectly. The cult that is undertaking rituals in the halls is an obvious answer, but the corcodillian that has taken up lair in the entranceway is also a problem. Being a simple beast the crocodillian isn't deliberately defending the cult but the more set in its lair it becomes the more defended (and dangerous) the cult becomes.</p>
<p>The whats of the Front can be dangers as well, even if they are important only in that they are a goal of another actor. The hole into the netherworld that the cult hopes to open could be a danger (probably of the Dark Portal type) with an impending doom as the portal gets bigger. Likewise an ancient idol being guarded in decrepit catacombs could be a danger itself and it draws unlucky souls to it.</p>
<p>The locations of a Front, the wheres, are as much a danger as the sentient creatures within them. The Swarming Halls of Xu'th'cal are not called "swarming" for nothing, after all. The Impending Dooms of a location danger may have to do with changes to the inhabitants of the location or to location itself: collapses, flooding, molten flows.</p>
<p>Finally, some Fronts have a Danger that answers the why of the Front. These Dangers are often the hidden movers that set things in motion. Maybe the cult is secretly funded by a cabal of priests of more upstanding religions, or perhaps the perpetual swarms of the Swarming Halls have been drawn by the slumbering demigod buried beneath it (whose power the cult is also tapping, unknowingly).</p>
<p>Of course these are all just options, I wouldn't use all of them for one Front, it would be too big for me to easily keep track of. If all of these were important to me I might make two Fronts for this adventure, splitting the features of the Halls from the dangers of the cult. Or maybe some of these wouldn't be dangers: an idea is only a Danger if you can see how it might get worse over time. If that corcodillian really is satisfied to just make its bed there and won't become more trouble over time then it's just a part of the cast of some other Danger, not a Danger itself.</p>
<p>Think of creating Dangers as slicing up your overall idea for a Front into smaller, easier to manage pieces. Creating Dangers is a tool for adding detail to the right parts of the Front and for making the Front easier to manage.</p>
<p>Once you have an idea for a Danger you need to choose a type for that Danger from the list below. Alternately you can use the list of types to inspire Dangers: with your front in mind ask yourself "What part of this Front might fit this Danger type?"</p>

<h3>Description and Cast</h3>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Write up something short to remind you just what this Danger is about. Something to describe it in a nutshell. Don’t worry about where it’s going or what it has planned—Grim Portents and the Impending Doom will handle that for you, you'll get to those in a bit. If there are multiple people involved in the Danger (an orc warlord and his clansmen, a hateful God and his servants) go ahead and give them a name and a detail or two now.</p>
<h3>Custom Moves</h3>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Sometimes, a Danger will require some particular move that might not exist yet. Write those moves up now. They may be player moves or GM moves, as you see fit. Of course, if you're writing a player move, keep your (the GMs) hands off the dice and keep in mind the basic structure of a move. A 10+ is a complete success; a 7–9 is a partial success. On a miss, maybe the custom move does something specific, or maybe not—maybe you just get to make a move or work towards fulfilling a Grim Portent. The formatting of these moves varies from move to move. See the Advanced Delving chapter for details on how to create your own.</p>
<h3>Grim Portents</h3>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Grim Portents are dark designs for what could happen. Imagine yourself a kind of diviner working some scrying spell into the future of your campaign or the adventure that the characters are undertaking. Think about what would happen if the Danger existed in the world but the PCs didn’t. If all these awful things you’ve conjured up had their run of the world. Scary, huh? The Grim Portents are your way to codify the plans and machinations of your Dangers. A Grim Portent can be a single interesting event or a chain of steps leading to a final Grim Portent. When you’re not sure what to do next—when the PCs have failed a roll with no immediate answers—push your Danger towards resolving a Grim Portent.</p>
<p>A Grim Portent with more than one step resolves step by step: cross of the first, then maybe later come back for the second. Each step is itself an even coming to pass, of course, but they all build together. A Grim Portent without steps just comes to pass, simple as that.</p>
<p>Think of your Grim Portents like possible moves waiting in the wings. You've picked out these awful things that may happen so that you can use them when the time is right.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="Example">Some examples: The Orcs overtake the village of Van Drell. Abdul Al-Kamar awakens the wicked god within. The White Portal opens at long last. The Thieves Guild makes a move on their rivals. The Sorceror King ratifies the Law of Divine Right. The Dragon eats the Princess.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="Example">The Encroaching Horde</p>
<ul><li aid:pstyle="Exampleli">Gnolls at the gates</li>
<li aid:pstyle="Exampleli">Gnolls inside the walls</li>
<li aid:pstyle="Exampleli">A gnoll foothold within the city</li>
<li aid:pstyle="Exampleli">The city falls to the gnolls</li></ul>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Grim Portents are the sword of inevitability that hangs over the characters. The struggles that they fight every day on the field of battle—in the courts of society and in the deepest dungeons of the world. Think about Grim Portents for the Danger as a group or individual members within it. Think externally (the effect of the Danger on the world around it) and internally (the politics or struggles of its members). Keep scale in mind, too. Grim Portents don’t all have to be world-shaking. They can simply represent a change in direction for a Danger. Some new way for it to cause trouble in the world.</p>
<p>When the last step of a Grim Portent comes to pass, check it off—these Portent is a part of the world, now. The prophecy has come true! A Portent that has come to pass might have ramifications for your other Fronts, too. Have a quick look when your players aren’t demanding your attention and feel free to make changes. One small Portent may resound across the whole Campaign.</p>
<p>You can advance a Grim Portent descriptively or prescriptively. Descriptively means through play you've already made that step happen, so you mark it off. Maybe the players helped the goblins against the lizardmen, so now the goblins control the tunnels, the next step in their Grim Portent. Prescriptive is where, due to a failed player move or a golden opportunity, you advance the Grim Portent as a move. That step comes to pass, show it's effects and move on to the next.</p>
<h3>Impending Doom</h3>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Behind every Danger is one of a few Impending Dooms. These are the final toll of the bell that signals the Danger’s resolution. These are the guiding light behind the Danger—what threat they represent. When a Grim Portent comes to pass the Impending Doom grows stronger, more apparent and present in the world. These are the Very Bad Things that every Danger, on some scale, seeks to bring into effect. Choose one of the type of Impending Dooms and give it a concrete vision in your Front.</p>
<ul><li>Tyranny (of the strong over the weak or the few over the many)</li>
<li>Pestilence (the spread of sickness and disease, the end of wellness)</li>
<li>Destruction (apocalypse, ruin and woe)</li>
<li>Usurpation (the chain of order comes apart, someone rightful is displaced)</li>
<li>Impoverishment (enslavement, the abandonment of goodness and right)</li>
<li>Rampant Chaos (laws of reality, of society or any order is dissolved)</li></ul>
<p>When all of the Grim Portents of a danger come to pass, the Impending Doom sets in. The Front can then be resolved but the setting has changed in some drastic way—even on a small level. Making sure that these effects are felt and significant to the NPCs, places and life of the campaign world is a big part of making them feel real.</p>
<h3>Stakes</h3>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Your stakes questions are 1–3 questions about people, places, or groups that you're interested in. People include characters and NPCs, your choice. Remember that your agenda includes "Play to find out what happens?" Well this is a way of reminding yourself what you want to find out.</p>
<p>Stakes are concrete and clear. Don't write stakes about vague feelings or incremental changes. Stakes are about important changes that affect the PCs and the world. A good stakes question is one that, when it's resolved, means that things will never be the same again.</p>
<p>The most important thing about stakes is that you find them interesting. Your stakes should be things that you genuinely want to know, but that you're also willing to not decide. Once you've written it as a stakes its out of your hands, you don't get to just make it up anymore. Now you have to play to find out.</p>
<p>Playing to find out is one of the biggest rewards of playing Dungeon World. You've written down something, tied to events happening in the world, that you want to find out about—now you get to do just that.</p>
<p>Once you have your stakes your front is ready to play.</p>
<h2>Resolving a Front</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Often, in Dungeon World, a Front will be resolved in a simple, straightforward manner. A Front representing a single dungeon may have its Dangers killed, turned to good, or defeated by some act of heroism. In this case the Front is dissolved and set aside. Maybe there are members of the Front—Dangers that go unresolved or leftover members of a Danger that’s been cleared that live on. Maybe they move to the Campaign Front as brand new Dangers? That’s up to you, of course.</p>
<p>The Campaign Front will need a bit more effort to resolve. It’ll be working slowly and subtly as the course of the Campaign rolls along. You won’t introduce or resolve it all at once, but in pieces. The PCs work towards defeating the various minions of the Big Bad that lives in your Campaign Front. In the end, though, you’ll know that the Campaign Front is resolved when the Dark God is confronted, the Undead Plague is wiped clear, and the heroes emerge bloodied but victorious. Campaign Fronts take longer to deal with, wandering from Adventure Front to Adventure Front fighting off your foes, but in the end, they’re the most satisfying to resolve.</p>
<p>When a Front is resolved, take some extra time to sit down and look at the aftermath. Did any Grim Portents come to pass? Even if a Danger is stopped, if one or two Grim Portents are fulfilled, the world is changed in small ways. Keep this in mind when you write your future Fronts. Is there anyone who could be moved from the now-defeated Front somewhere else? Anyone get promoted or reduced in stature? The resolution of a Front is an important event!</p>
<p>When you resolve a Front, usually the adventure itself has been resolved. This is a great time to take a break and look at The Campaign Front you have. Let it inspire your next Adventure Front. Write up an Adventure Front or polish off one you’ve been working on, draw a few maps to go with it and get ready for the next big adventure.</p>
<h2>Multiple Adventure Fronts</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">As mentioned above, the ideal place for the players to be is dealing with multiple fronts. They'll always have at least an Adventure Front and the Campaign Front on their minds, but often you'll find two (or more) Adventure Fronts really keep them on their toes.</p>
<p>When running two Adventure Fronts at the same time they can be intertwined or independent. The Cult of Gol'ul corrupting the city from the inside is a different front from the orc hordes laying siege outside, but they'd both be in play at once. On the other hand one dungeon could have multiple Fronts at play within it's walls: the powers and effects of the location itself, maybe, and the warring humanoid tribes that inhabit it.</p>
<p>A situation warrants multiple Adventure Fronts when there are multiple Impending Dooms, all equally potent but unrelated. The Impending Doom of the Cult is their rulership of the city, the Impending Doom of the orcs is the city in ruins. Unlike the Grim Portents of the Dangers of a single Front these separate Fronts don't contribute to the same Impending Doom.</p>
<p>When dealing with multiple Adventure Fronts the players are likely to prioritize. The cult needs attention now, the orcs can wait, or vice versa. These decisions lead to the slow advancement of the neglected Front, eventually causing more problems for the players and leading to new adventures. It's a delicious cycle.</p>
